        <h4> WEB APPLICATION | BLOC PROJECT | CASE STUDY </h4>
        <p> Ridestarter is a crowdfunding website application for organizations and individuals looking to
          either raise funds or donate to charity bike rides across the world. Users can choose to create a bike
          campaign, supporting specific causes of their choosing or browse and donate through the different active bike campaigns.</p>

        <h2> Problem Statement </h2>
        <h1> A search for Charity bike challenges </h1>
        <p> The net market exists several popular crowdfunding services such as GoFundme, Kickstarter, and Indiegogo.
          However, many of these web services either cater to holistic campaigns or specific ones such as creative projects.
          When users want to create a charity bike ride campaign, they would need to host their campaign through either the organization
          they're funding for or a general crowd-sourced site. Unfortunately, there isn't a centralized crowdsourced site for
          charity bike rides.  </p>
      </div>

  <section class="solution">
    <div class="container">
      <h2> Solution Overview</h2>
      <h1> A Trusted Crowdfunding Medium </h1>
      <p> Ridestarter seeks to consolidate charity bike rides and allow users to crowd-sourced
        for ride projects in one central location. The goal for Ridestarter is to enable donors and fundraisers to come
        together in supporting charity rides for causes they care about. Donors can browse and donate to a specific
        cause of their choosing while fundraisers can effortlessly build bike projects through an intuitive creation flow.   </p>

      <h2> Discovery & Strategy Phase </h2>
      <h1> Getting to know my Users </h1>
      <p> At this initial stage, it was crucial to gain a better understanding of users' behavior of
        donating to a charity or spearheading a fundraiser. The survey was aimed towards a group of people
      who have made donations, created fundraiser projects, participated in charity bike ride and also users
      who have neither fundraised or donated.</p>
      <ul class="list">
          <li> Type of donation users have made out to </li>
          <li> Reasons for why users donate </li>
          <li> Reasons for why users don't donate </li>
          <li> User donation habits </li>
          <li> Frustrations when managing a fundraiser </li>
      </ul>

      <div class="middle">
        <h3> Interviewing my Users </h3>
        <p> In addition to sending out the survey, I held user interviews with both users who have
        donated and fundraised. It was also important to target users who have been on charity bike rides to gain
        a deeper understanding of the pain points when creating a bike campaign.</p>
      </div>
        <blockquote> I rather donate to people or organizations that I can connect personally with  </blockquote>
        <blockquote> It would be cool to get potential riders to participate in the charity</blockquote>
        <blockquote> Donating to smaller charities such as giving a dollar to a struggling kid is more impactful than
        funding a larger organization </blockquote>

        <div class="middle">
          <h3> Research Insights </h3>
          <p> 1. Often time, users are hesitant to donate online due to not knowing where their
          money is going to. I sought to answer how might we create trust and transparency to debunk
          hesitation and build a rapport with the users.</p>
          <p> 2. From a fundraiser's perspective, the biggest pain point was marketing and how to
          incentivize users outside of the riders' mutual circle to donate to a campaign. </p>

    <div class="container">
      <h1> Constructing my Audiences</h1>
      <p> Following the user survey and interviews, I used the feedback as the jumping
      off point to create user personas. I was able to
      craft and hone two relevant personas: bargain hunter - one who spends an exorbitant amount of time
      looking for the best deals and power-shopper - one who is driven by a specific need and know specifically what they want.
      With the personas, I was able to bring more empathy to the early phases and eventually throughout the project.  </p>

      <h2> Information Architecture Phase</h2>
      <h1> Distilling the Flow Process</h1>
      <p> Before touching on the wireframes, I wanted to ensure the clarity of Ridestarter's goals and structures.
        To do that, I created a detailed sitemap from the start of the landing page to the different
        elements of a crowdfunding site. </p>

        <h3> User Flow </h3>
        <p> Using the user stories as a guide to deliver a sufficient user flow, I focused on the
        development of both donors and fundraisers alike.  </p>

      <h1> Developing the Initial Screens</h1>
      <p> To show potential users how the application is supposed to function and be built,
         I designed the low-fidelity wireframes in Balsamiq based on the user stories. It was also essential
       to remember to develop from both the donators and fundraisers' experience. Given that mind, I created
       wireframes from the fundraiser's perspective where they can manage and edit their projects. </p>

      <h2> Visual Identity Phase </h2>
      <h1> Cycling through the Brand Identity </h1>
      <p> With Ridestarter being a crowdfunding application, eliciting trust and emotion are the
        most important facet of getting users to use the site. The color palette was comprised mainly of the color green. Green was used as the primary color for
        Ridestarter because not only green conveys with money and funds, but also promotes
        an association for nature and foliages, which are all presented during a rider's journey.</p>

      <h2> Prototyping Phase </h2>
      <h1> Finalizing the Crowdfunding Screens </h1>
      <p> Following the completion and testing of the low-fidelity wireframes,
        I began on the construction of the high-fidelity wireframes. </p>
      <div class="middle">
        <h3> Charity Page View </h3>
        <p>The main charity page follows a minimum viable product based on the

        <h3> Filtering and Sorting System </h3>
        <p> With many crowdfunding projects out there, this streamlined filtering and
        sorting system allow for users to tailor down the specific projects of their choice.</p>
        <a href="images/ridestarter/discover.png"><img src="images/ridestarter/discover.png"></a>

        <h3> Conveying Reputation</h3>
        <p> Based on the user research, one of the leading factors in users not
          committing to a donation is being unsure of the fundraiser's trustworthiness. Donors must feel safe donating to creators, so
          it's important to also focus on the project owner's credibility.</p>

      <h2> Usability Phase </h2>

      <h1> Building Trust through Transparency </h1>
      <p> Disclosing reputation and personal information was important
        for potential donors to empathize with the fundraisers and make a donation. However, I knew I was struggling with users intuitively navigating to the
        fundraiser's profile page. </p>
      <a href="images/ridestarter/click.png"><img src="images/ridestarter/click.png"></a>

      <div class="middle">
        <h3> Click Test Result </h3>
        <p> By gathering more than 50 click test responses, my assumption was wrong as a majority of testers successfully
          clicked on the correct element (creator's image), despite a few outliers. However, I wanted to emphasize the fundraiser's reputation further.
          So I added another profile link avenue by creating a small button under the fundraiser's name to view their profile. </p>

  <section class="reflection">
    <div class="container">
      <h1> Reflections </h1>
      <p>1. Ridestarter has a value in allowing users to exclusively search and donate to charity bike rides,
        solving the problem of transparency in crowd-sourcing charity projects. Building an application with the goal to get people to not only get excited
        to donate money, but also create trust and openness in the platform requires thoughtful decisions in the design process.
        What’s difficult, but significant was coming up with the right questions to ask in the user survey
        to uncover underlying goals and motives. The interview process was a humbling experience in learning more
         about the different perspective from both the donators and fundraisers. Asking questions and
         empathizing to explore deeper into the users’ mind was an experience that allowed me to reflect
         on what is considered a good user interview process.  </p>

         <p>2. An area for improvement with Ridestarter would be to research more on what to include in a charity ride crowdfunding platform -
           what is needed to either get people interested in riding or donating to ride projects. The good news is that an application
           is never a final product as design and iteration is an ongoing process. I hope to further improve on the aesthetic and
           functionality of Ridestarter to create a good crowdfunding user experience. </p>
