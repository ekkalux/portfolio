        <h4> MOBILE APPLICATION | BLOC PROJECT | CASE STUDY </h4>
        <p> Today, defining and maintaining fitness is open to interpretation. Whether that
        be health, sports, or recreational activity, Gymseeker seeks to assist users in finding
      the perfect gym to achieving their fitness goals.  </p>

        <h2> Problem Statement</h2>
        <h1> There are too many gyms to choose from </h1>
        <p>Finding the right gym is different for everyone. Whether that is location, price or types of
        services offered, users must go through a rigorous research process before
        committing. Applications such as Yelp does aid in the process of locating a gym, but it isn't
        comprehensive enough to cover the entirety of a gym's profile. Additionally, when expectations aren't met,
        users are not satisfied with their gym and may potentially neglect their fitness goals. </p>
      </div>

  <section class="solution">
    <div class="container">
      <h2> Solution Overview</h2>
      <h1> Achieving Fitness Goals at the Right Gym</h1>
      <p> Gymseeker makes the process of finding a gym easier by streamlining the research
      and selection phase based on the users' needs. Users can search for gyms based on location and
    view gym's profile before making a commitment to purchasing a membership, easing users in the decision-making process. </p>

      <h2> Discovery & Strategy Phase </h2>
      <h1> Getting to know my Users </h1>
      <p> I initiated my research by crafting a 15 questions user survey to
      find out users' goals and pain points. By targeting audiences from all experiences with
      gym-related components, I gathered more than 40 comprehensive responses. From this survey, I needed to learn the
      following: </p>
      <ul class="list">
          <li> User's fitness goals </li>
          <li> What factor is essential in selecting a gym </li>
          <li> What frustrations do users have with their current gym </li>
          <li> What stops users from going to the gym  </li>
          <li> What type of membership do they currently have </li>
      </ul>
      <img src="images/gymseeker/research.png">
      <div class="middle">
        <h3> Interviewing my Users </h3>
        <p> Following the user survey, I held interviews with four different users to gather qualitative
          insights on their gym behavior. </p>
      </div>
        <blockquote> Sometimes I have too much work to do so I get lazy to hit the gym </blockquote>
        <blockquote> My gym is ugly. So even though the exercise gives me a mental break, I wish
        that it didn't feel so uninspiring  </blockquote>
        <blockquote> Flexibility in attending classes at multiple gyms within walking distance of my home </blockquote>

        <div class="middle">
          <h3> Research Insights </h3>
          <p> 1. Buying a gym membership can be stressful for most users. With all the different factors
          presented (e.g community, overcrowding, lack of certain types of equipments), it is vital that Gymseeker eases users
          into simplifying decision-making when choosing a gym. </p>
          <p> 2. People want to meet their fitness goals, but find it hard to do so when they are met
          with pain points like being too tired from work or the gym is too far to make the trip. They will
          make more of the effort if their external inhibitors aren't deterring them. </p>
          <p> 3. I learned that users tend to associate gyms with the weight room. Based
          on this insight, I want to ensure that a gym profile on screen contains weight-related elements. </p>

      <h1> Who are my Audiences </h1>
      <p> To gain a better understanding of what specific features were desired and
      what kind of people are likely to user Gymseeker, I compiled my research to create
    three different user personas: Avid gym-goer, occasional gym-goer, and amateur gym-goer.
    These personas will guide me to design an intuitive flow for Gymseeker.  </p>

      <h1> Centralizing the Volume of Information </h1>
      <p> After getting a better insight of the users, I could move on to creating
      the information architecture of Gymseeker. To plan out the structure of Gymseeker, I
      created a sitemap to use as a reference point for the creation of wireframes and
      functional specifications. </p>

      <p> With the completed user stories and user flows, I created low-fidelity wireframes with
      Balsamiq and then transferred it to clickable prototypes using Invision for user testing. I made
      sure to test the initial screens with my peers and target users and convening all the insights
      into the next iteration of designs. </p>

        show only the hours on the day of. Consequentially, I created a new call to action to

        a style that would evoke the feeling of energy and motivation. Yellow and orange
        came first to mind, but I decided on the color blue to represent the sense
        of prowess and strength. </p>

    <div class="container">
      <h2> Usability Phase </h2>
      <h1> Iterating the Button Sizes </h1>
      <p> When users were tasked with finding a gym, I noticed that users tend to stay on the map view and
      didn't see the list view unless otherwise hinted. Besides, designing mobile applications require
      buttons to be more prominent due to users' thumb size. By making the accessibility for both views larger,
      users can easily see and navigate from one perspective to the other.</p>

      <a href="images/gymseeker/map.png"><img src="images/gymseeker/map.png"></a>
      <h1> Designing the List View </h1>
      <p> When presented with the list view, users mentioned that they had trouble reading some of the contents.
      To accommodate this pain point, I increased readability by increasing the fonts universally and applying
      a darker visual element to the list view. Showing this screen again, users were impressed with
      the visual hierarchy of the screen. </p>

    <div class="container">
      <h1> Reflections </h1>
      <p> 1. Gymseeker is a project that I am particularly passionate about.
        As a fitness enthusiast who frequents the weight room, I have only considered
        locating gyms based on what types of equipment a gym has in their
        weight room. With Gymseeker, users are presented with a holistic detail of a gym's profile before
        committing to purchasing a membership.  </p>

      <p> 2. For this iOS application, I delved deep into the user testing process and have made many iterations based on
        feedback. In future development of the current product and due to time constraints, I would consider an additional feature that allows users to
      sort through the different types of a gym - Yoga center, dance center, athletic clubs, etc. This would provide users with a
      comprehensive direction to filter through their fitness goals. </p>
