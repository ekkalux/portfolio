        <h1> A Problem to Solve</h1>
        <p>Finding the right gym is different for everyone. Whether that is location, price or types of
        services offered, users must go through a rigorous research process before making a
        commitment. Applications such as Yelp does aid in the process of locating a gym, but it isn't
        comprehensive enough to cover the entirety of a gym's profile. Additionally, when expecations aren't met,
        users are not satisfied with their gym and may potentially neglect their fitness goals. </p>

      <h2> Discovery & Strategy Phase </h2>
      <h1> Getting to know my Users </h1>
      <p> I initiated my research by crafting a 15 questions user survey in order to
      find out users' goals and pain points. Through this survey, I needed to learn the
    following: </p>
      <ul class="list">
          <li> User's fitness goals </li>
          <li> What factor is important in selecting a gym </li>
          <li> What frustrations do users have with their current gym </li>
          <li> What stops users from going to the gym  </li>
          <li> What type of membership do they currently have </li>

        <h3> Interviewing my Users </h3>

        <blockquote> Sometimes I have too much work to do so I get lazy to hit the gym </blockquote>
        <blockquote> My gym is ugly. So even though the exercise gives me a mental break, I wish
        that it didn't feel so uninspiring  </blockquote>
        <blockquote> Flexibility in attending classes at multiple gyms within walking distance of my home </blockquote>

        <div class="middle">
          <h3> Research Insights </h3>
          <p> 1. Buying a gym membership can be stressful for most users. With all the different factors
          presented (e.g community, overcrowding, lack of certain equipments), it is important that Gymseeker eases users
          in simplifying decision-making when choosing a gym. </p>
          <p> 2. People wants to meet their fitness goals, but find it hard to do so when they are met
          with pain points like being too tired from work or the gym is too far to make the trip.</p>

      <p> To gain a better understanding of what specific features were desired and
      what kind of people are likely to user Gymseeker, I compiled my research to create
    three different user personas: Avid gym-goer, occasional gym-goer and amateur gym-goer.
    These personas will guide me to design an intuitive flow for Gymseeker.  </p>

      <h1> Reflections </h1>
      <p> 1. Gymseeker is a project that I am particularly passionate about.
        As a fitness enthusiast who frequents the weight room, I have only considered
        locating gyms based on what types of equipments a gym has in their
        weight room. With Gymseeker, users are presented with a holistic detail of a gym's profile before
        making a commitment to purchasing a membership.  </p>

      <p> 2. For this iOS application, I delved deep in the user testing process and have made many iterations based on
        feedback. In future development of the current product and due to time constraints, I would consider an additional feature that allows users to
      sort through the different types of gym - Yoga center, dance center, athlethic clubs, etc. This would provide users with a
      comprehensive direction to filter through their fitness goals. </p>
