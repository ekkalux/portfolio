        <h1> Shopping online isn't the same as in Store  </h1>
        <p>Surely there are ecommerce sites that offer outdoor gears for the thrill-seekers.
          Even with these shopping sites, their items focus on a general selection of apparels
          and gears - with backpacks specifically hidden in their many choices. Coupling with some of
          the unnecessary flows to purchasing an online product. </p>

    <h2> Discovery & Strategy Phase </h2>
    <h1> Getting Personal with my Users</h1>
    <p> To kick off my research, I surveyed many different types of users. From outdoor
    enthusiasts to general shoppers, I wanted to find out about the following users habits and perspectives
  in the following areas: </p>
    <ul class="list">
        <li> How do users shop for backpacks?</li>
        <li> Which backpack features are the most important?</li>
        <li> What activities do users partake in?</li>
        <li> Online shopping habits </li>
        <li> Frustrations when shopping online </li>
    </ul>

    <img src="images/equipax/research.png">

    <div class="middle">
      <h3> Interviewing my Users </h3>
      <p> To supplement my research, I sat down with four different users to discuss about their
      shopping habits and what drives them to shop online. It was very important to dig deep
      in different angles as to what would provide a good shopping experience for potential users.</p>
    </div>
      <blockquote> I use wikibuy to match prices for a product around the internet. Helps me find
        better deals and save money </blockquote>
      <blockquote> I don't like shopping online because if the item doesn't fit me, then I'd
        have to go through the hassle of returning it </blockquote>
      <blockquote> Sometimes it's more pricey online, but the extra price is worth the trip
      of going to the store </blockquote>

      <div class="middle">
        <h3> Research Insights </h3>
        <p> 1. Most users shop for backpacks mainly for its functionality. Although
        style and colors add to the appeal, it seems to be less important than price and the practicality of a product. </p>
        <p> 2. Users are very caution of online shopping due to its inconsistency between online and
        in-store impression. Mirroring an in-store experience is very important for users to selecting the right product. </p>
        <p> 3. Often time, users are met with a wide selection of items. This can be overwhelming for shoppers,
        creating an uncertainty of purchasing an item with the right balance in price and quality. </p>

<section class="personas">
  <div class="container">
    <h1> Who is up for an adventure? </h1>
    <p> Following the user survey and interviews, I used the feedback as the jumping
    off point to create user personas. I was able to
    craft and hone two relevant personas: bargain hunter - one who spends an exorbitant amount of time
    looking for the best deals and power-shopper - one who are driven by a specific need and know exactly what they want.
    With the personas, I was able to bring more empathy to the early phases and eventually throughout the project.  </p>

    <h1> Be Inspired of Who Am I Up Against </h1>
    <p> To gain a better understanding of the outdoor market, I wanted to familiarize myself with
      Equipax's competitors to gain a better understanding of the similar problems that Equipax
      attempts to solve. Below is a quick summary of the competitor audit. </p>

    <div class="middle">
      <h3> Opportunities for Equipax </h3>
      <p> 1. Majority of ecommerce outdoor gears site focuses on a holistic selection
          of apparels, ranging from clothings to tents. This present an opportunity for
          Equipax to shine in just solely selling outdoor backpacks. </p>

    <h2> Information Architecture Phase</h2>
    <h1> Maintaining a Minimum Viable Product </h1>
    <p> Using Google Sheets and Draw.io, I created both user stories and user flows based on
      my research to develop a minimum viable product. For both new and returning users,
      being able to find a specific backpack and knowing where to complete a purchase are the
      most critical to building Equipax. </p>

<section class="low-fidelity">
  <div class="container">
    <h1> Crafting the Origin Wireframes</h1>
    <p> Keeping the research in mind, I used Sketch to produce medium-fidelity
    wireframes. After completing the wireframes, I presented the mockups to three potential users.
    I wanted to focus on making sure that the screen flow caters to my personas' needs.
    Specifically I wanted to ensure that users can successfully scout for a backpack and
    purchase it through the end.  </p>

    <h2> Visual Identity Phase </h2>
    <h1> Evoking Outdoorsman through Branding </h1>
    <p> To begin the branding process, I needed a name for the product. Going through
    several iterations of mind-mapping, I eventually landed on Equipax. "Equip" and "backpack"
    were synthesized to form Equipax, simply meaning to put on a backpack. To further the logo,
    I vecterized the letter Q to resemble the two straps on a backpack and assigned it with the
    brand's two primary colors.</p>
    <div class="middle">
      <h3> Logo Design </h3>
      <img src="images/equipax/logo.png">
    </div>

    <p> When building the visual identity for Equipax, I wanted to convey an outdoor feel
    while maintaining a clean ecommerence design. The maroon and green are used as the primary
    colors. The yellow color is used both as an accent to complement the main colors and as
    a call to action. The typeface - Avenir - is intended to emphasize a modern look with different
    angles of kerning and spacing for headings and paragraphs. </p>

      high-fidelity wireframes, using the style guide to help communciate the visual language and
      convey the design direction. </p>

<section class="usability">
  <div class="container">
    <h2> Usability Phase </h2>

    <h1> Mirroring an In-Store Experience </h1>
    <p> To evaluate whether users have easy accessibility to a live support
    agent, I conducted a click test and was able to gather 21 responses. Based on
      the test, users had no trouble finding the live chat button. </p>
    <a href="images/equipax/clicktest.png"><img src="images/equipax/clicktest.png"></a>
    <h1> Additional User Testing </h1>
    <p> 1. Testers were met with positive interaction with Equipax. Users can clearly
    identify the navigation flow from the start of finding a backpack to completing
    a successful purchase. </p>
    <p> 2. Consistency is also very important when going through the purchasing screens of an item
    where a lot of information are presented. A second promo code registration option was added
    to the Shipping/Payment page when users hinted that they couldn't add a promo code unless having to
    go back to the cart page.</p>

<section class="reflection">
  <div class="container">
    <h1> Reflections </h1>
    <p> 1. Designing Equipax turned out to be a project that I am passionate about while
    going through the UX cycle. I develed deeper in the research process in this project, analyzing
    how I can create an eccomerce site that fits to the users' shopping experience. </p>
    <p> 2. As for future development, it would be a challenge to attach a philanthropic cause
    to Equipax. People buy from those they can relate to and aspire to emulate so by establising a connection
    with shoppers, they can experience the value of participating in a product. </p>
