  <div class"about">
    <p> Hello, my name is Ekkalux Nguyen and I am a recent UC Berkeley graduate with a passion for user experience design.

I started my journey to become a UX designer six months ago when I came across an online UX bootcamp called Bloc. In this program, I have immersed myself in learning the principles of both UX foundation and front-end development, while producing projects that requires me to research, iterate, and design. I am still an apprentice and am in the process of finishing up the program.

I have an affinity for making mobile apps, websites, and other digital products to solve problems that affects peopleâ€™s health and fitness. Applications like these need to be extremely intuitive because of the vast dimension of knowing the end-users. I aspire to bridge the gap between design and health/fitness by leveraging my experience to bring a level of empathy and attention to detail in making gorgeous, yet intuitive and functional applications.

In my free time, I enjoy staying active, lifting, hiking, traveling, and hanging out with friends.
