    <h1> SUMMARY </h1>
    <p> simpleBox is a SaaS web application which allows users to collect information and store it in a
      single place. Users can create documents, store images, links to websites, and
      collaborate with others. </p>

  <div class="solution_container">
    <h1> SOLUTION </h1>
    <p> Due to the increase amount of mobile collaboration tools, technological jargon and cluttered services deter
      users from using the specific product. Simplebox simplifies this and creates a tool that is easily accessible for all users to conveniently save and
      share content across multiple devices. Users start off with a free account and can then toggle between different priced account.

    <h1> UX RESEARCH </h1>
    <p> User surveys and user stories are used to decide what features are necessary
      for simpleBox. To do that, I sent out a survey to find out what users were proactively
       using, their habits, and their competition in content and devices use.
       From the data that I’ve collected, I was able to come up with appriopriate
       user stories and personas to help me understand users’ goals, behaviors, and
       how they will interact with the application. </p>

  <div class="research_results">
    <p> 63% of users typically use their smart phones to browse the net. </p>
    <p> 50% of users typically use their laptop to browse the net. </p>
    <p> 63% of users save online content by bookmarking it in their browser </p>
    <p> What most users like about using tools to bookmark is that it is convenient and
      integrated across all of their devices </p>
    <p> What most users don't like about these tools is that most of them are complicated
      and has too many features. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="research_container_2">
    <p>Based on the survey, I was able to determine that simpleBox needs to be accessbile
      across multiple platforms because majority of users use laptop or smartphones to browse
      the internet. Additionally, organization and centralization seems to be the main theme
      from the survey. Many users feel that some of the tools they use leads to a clutter
      space, particulary bookmarking. Therefore, it is important that simpleBox provides a
      space of organization for the end-users. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="user_flow"> User Flow <hr>
    <p>From the research, I made a list of user stories to help me create user flows.
      In the diagram, I focus on the different user experience for both new and returning
      users, with several similarities. This process helped me craft a minimum viable
      product for simpleBox. </p>

<section class="branding">
  <h1> BRANDING AND TYPOGRAPHY </h1>
  <p> The next step in building the application is deciding on the brand and typography.
    The main goal of this web app is to provide a collection of notes, images, and links
    where users can store and share. Therefore, I wanted the brand and typography to
    reflect on the scheme of both professional and personal and casual usage. </p>

<section class="low_fidelity">
  <h1> USABILITY TESTING </h1>
  <p>After defining the brand identity for simpleBox, I created low-fidelity/medium
    fidelity wireframes with balsamiq and photoshop to test on usertesting.com and
    in-person to see whether the product was user friendly to the users. These are
    the main questions I asked. </p>
  <p><b>1. Look around and talk about what you think this is about? What can you do
    here? What is it for? What strikes you about it? </b></p>
  <p><b> 2. Think of something you want to do here. Try and do that thing. </p>
  <p>3. What, if anything, do you like or dislike? Since this isn’t a final version,
    what would you like to see in the final version. </b> </p>
  <p>Based on the test, users understand full well what the application does, referring
    to similarities to other tools such as dropbox. They also like the simplicity of the design and logo. </p>

<section class="high_fidelity">
  <h1> HIGH-FIDELITY PROTOTYPES </h1>
  <p>After going through user testing for the low/medium prototypes and making iteration based on feedback, I used
    Sketch to create high-fidelity prototypes. Then I made a clickable prototypes on InVision and asked users to
    navigate through the prototypes and provide feedback. Below are the discussion questions
    I asked during the interview process: </p>

  <p><b>1. What do you make of the page? What strikes you about it?</b> </p>
  <p><b>2. What frustrations do you have when navigating through the pages?</b> </p>
  <p><b>3. What are some things that you like about the website?</b> </p>
  <p><b>4. Do you see yourself using this application? Why or Why not?</b> </p>
  <p>Overall, users thought that the experience was pleasing and that the application is presentable in a simplified, yet professional design. </p>

  <p>However, I found out that there was a slight delay when users were trying to add content to simpleBox. To tackle this issue, I created two
    versions of the dashboard with two different placements of the add button. I then conducted
     a <b>preference test on UsabilityHub </b> to see which version is more intuitive.
     Based on the results, version one (original) performs better than version two by 80:20.
     The test had 10 responses which may not be the best representative of the majority. Although
     the add button in version two is bigger, it was slightly more difficult to spot according to
     some users. Therefore, it was safe to conclude that the placement of the add button in version one is more intuitive. </p>

  <h1> FINAL PRODUCT </h1>
  <div class="conclusion">
    <p>After researching, user testing, and designing through Balsamiq, Illustrator, and
      Photoshop/Sketch, the final product is completed with harmoniously-working colors and
      design elements that achieve simpleBox’s goal in creating a friendly user experience in
      collecting and sharing contents. </p>
    <p>This was my first project going through the different UX process as a designer. This project
      had made me realize how important it is to test often and early to create an intuitive user experience
      for potential end-users. Designing is more than just creating visually appealing elements.
      Data and research are the main components to synthesizing the design elements. </p>

    <h1> Front-End Development </h1> <hr>
    <p> HTML, CSS, and Javascript were used in conjunction to develop the homepage of Simplebox.
      Because Simplebox is targeted for users to access through different devices, I designed the
      homepage as mobile-first to ensure its responsiveness across different outlets. </p>
