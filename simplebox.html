    <h1>  UX RESEARCH  </h1>
    <p> User surveys and user stories were used to decide what features are necessary
      for simpleBox. To do that, I sent out a survey to find out what users were proactively
       using, their habits, and their competition in content and devices use.
       From the data that I’ve collected, I was able to come up with appriopriate
       user stories and personas to help me understand users’ goals, behaviors, and
       how they will interact with the application. <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeWYnTRaJtMD_MQmnj9SEyzbvujD2AoGVLqC7JIrZ8Q-voMyw/viewform" target="_blank">

    <div class="highlights">
      <ul>
        <li> 63% of users typically use their smart phones to browse the net. </li>
        <li> 50% of users typically use their laptop to browse the net. </li>
        <li> 63% of users save online content by bookmarking it in their browser </li>
        <li> What most users like about using tools to bookmark is that it is convenient and
        integrated across all of their devices </li>
        <li> What most users don't like about these tools is that most of them are complicated
        and has too many features. </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <p>Based on the survey, I was able to determine that simpleBox needs to be accessbile
      across multiple platforms because majority of users use laptop or smartphones to browse
      the internet. Additionally, organization and centralization seems to be the main theme
      from the survey. Many users feel that some of the tools they use leads to a clutter
      space, particulary bookmarking. Therefore, it is important that simpleBox provides a
      space of organization for the end-users. </p>

      <p>From the research, I made a list of user stories to help me create user flows.
        In order to easily identify the steps taken to the end-process, I focus on the different user experience for both new and returning
        users, with several similarities. This process helped me craft and prioritize the minimum viable
        product features for simpleBox.<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0bktw2AN4LKdGxCVUhjdExSS3c/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">

  <p> The next step in building the application is deciding on the brand and typography.
    The main goal of this web app is to provide a collection of notes, images, and links
    where users can store and share. Therefore, I wanted the brand and typography to
    reflect on the scheme of both professional and casual usage. </p>

  <h1>USABILITY TESTING </h1>
  <p>To evaluate the product's user experience and identify flaws, I conducted usability testings on usertesting.com and
    in-person to see whether the product was user friendly to users. These are
    the main questions that I asked. </p>
  <div class="highlights">
    <ul>
      <li>Look around and talk about what you think this is about? What can you do
        here? What is it for? What strikes you about it? </li>
      <li>Think of something you want to do here. Try and do that thing. </li>
      <li>What, if anything, do you like or dislike? Since this isn’t a final version,
        what would you like to see in the final version. </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="highlights">
    <ul>
      <li> <b>In-Person Testing:</b> Users had a positive response to the application and were able to navigate through
        the site smoothly. They also liked the simplicity of the site and the logo.  </li>
      <li> <b>Unmoderated User Testing:</b> To gain more insights about the application, I conducted an unmoderated usability test on Peek. Based from the
        test, the user was able to quickly identify simpleBox's functionality, referring to similiarites to other applications such as dropbox, where you can store
        and save documents. Since the test was unmoderated, I wasn't able to follow up with questions or answer some of the concerns that
        the tester had. Although the user might not have known that this is a medium-fidelity prototype, she was confused about the color scheme of
        black, white, and gray. However, it was significant that the tester understood the goal of simpleBox. <a href="http://www.usertesting.com/v/5adc95f3-123c-44f8-a895-7e87d103c3be?encrypted_video_handle=4WyztmbyzJ7n2ccqSBtaWg&shared=hiWH_1Eg" target="_blank">

  <div class="container">
  <h1> HIGH-FIDELITY PROTOTYPES </h1>
  <p>After going through user testing for the low/medium prototypes and making iteration based on feedback, I used
    Sketch to create high-fidelity prototypes. Then I made another clickable prototypes with InVision and asked a few more users to
    navigate through the prototypes and provide feedback. I conducted another unmoderated user test. <a href="http://www.usertesting.com/v/f0ad361e-6fcd-4a05-8e1c-5c977715689e?encrypted_video_handle=tHdsGv9x0MymeSOqYu_RvQ&shared=M2VgP9nf">
    You can view the full video here.</a> Below are the discussion questions
    I asked during the usability testing. </p>

  <div class="highlights">
    <ul>
      <li> What do you make of the page? What strikes you about it?</li>
      <li> What frustrations do you have when navigating through the pages? </li>
      <li> What are some things that you like about the website? </li>
      <li> From the landing page, sign into simplebox, and create either a note, image, or link. Were there
      any frustrations from doing so?</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <p><b>Results: </b>Overall, users thought that the experience was pleasing and that the application is presentable in a simplified, yet professional design.
  The responses were more convincing when testing with the high-fidelity wireframes because users were able easily visualize the final presentation of the platform.
  In addition, when asked to sign in and create either a note, image, or link, users had no trouble taking that action and were able to do so without any frustrations.</p>

  <div class="highlights">
    <p> From the testing, I found out that there was a slight delay when users were attempting to add content to simpleBox. To tackle this issue, I created two
      versions of the dashboard with two different placements of the add button. Afterwards, I conducted
     a preference test on UsabilityHub to see which version is more intuitive.
     Based on the results, version one (original) performs better than version two by 80:20.
     The test had 10 responses which may not be the best representative of the majority. Although
     the add button in version two is bigger, it was slightly more difficult to spot according to
     some users. Therefore, it was safe to conclude that the placement of the add button in version one is more intuitive.

    <h1><span class="underline_black"> CONCLUSION</span></h1>
    <p> After researching, user testing, and designing through Balsamiq, Illustrator, and
      Photoshop/Sketch, the final product was completed with harmoniously-working colors and
      design elements that achieve simpleBox’s goal in creating a friendly user experience in
      collecting and sharing contents. </p>

    <p> From simpleBox, I learned the importance of relying on data and interviews to create an intuitive product for the end-user.
      Designing is more than just creating visually appealing elements. It’s easy to detach myself from designing from the user’s experience, but something that is designed from my own satisfactory might not be intuitive to other users.
      In addition, understanding the code methods for mobile-first development was slightly challenging, but worth it in today’s advancement in creating good user experience.
      It’s important to keep in mind that many users today use their mobile devices to browse through different applications on the net.
