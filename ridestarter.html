    <h1> SUMMARY </h1> <hr>
    <p> Ridestarter is a crowdfunding website application for organizations and individuals looking to
      either raise funds or donate to charity bike rides across the world. Users can choose to create a bike
      campaign, supporting specific causes or browse through the different bike charities that are offered.</p>
  </div>

<section class="solution">
  <div class="solution_container">
    <h1> SOLUTION</h1>
    <p> There are a lot of existing crowd-sourced fundraising web applications such as Kickstarter,
      GoFundme, and Indiegogo. However, many of these applications cater towards personal or general projects. When pertaining to
      charity bike rides, a well-designed solution hasn't been created.
      The goal of Ridestarter is to centralize charity bike rides across the world and allow users to crowd-source
      for ride projects. In addition to attracting the cyclist community, Ridestarter allows donors and fundraisers to come
      together in supporting charity rides for causes they care about.   </p>

    <h1> RESEARCHING THE CHALLENGES </h1> <hr>

    <div class="survey_findings"> <b>Survey Findings</b>
      <p> At this initial stage, it was important to gain a better understanding of users' behavior of
        donating to a charity or spearheading a fundraiser. The survey was aimed towards a group of people
      who have made donations, created fundraiser projects, participated in charity bike ride and also users
      who have neither fundraised or donated. These results were important in deciding not only the features of Ridestarter, but also what
        is necessary in order to create a successful crowdfunding application. </p>

      <b><p>1. 50% of respondents felt that the progress bar and fundraising are the most important
      features. </p>
      <p>2. Some respondents felt the process of creating an account and going
      through the donation flow are a hassle that takes a toll of their time. </p>
      <p>3. People usually don’t donate because they are sketpical of donation sites -
      where the money is going to and how much of an impact they are making. Another
      popular response is that they feel that their donation is too small to make a difference. </p> </b>

      <p>In addition to the survey, I also conducted user interviews on
      people who have been on charity bike rides and have experienced through the fundraising process. These are my findings: </p>

      <b><p>1. Fundraisers generally have to reach out to the organization that they’re
        supporting to host the fundraising site. This makes it hard to gain traction from
        the cyclist community to contribute fundings.  </p>
      <p>2. One interesting observation was that people are more likely to donate or feel more
        comfortable fundraising if the project entice challenges rather than just "asking for money". </p> </b>

    <div class="competitive_analysis"> <b> Competitive Analysis </b>
      <p> I analyzed four different crowdfunding companies in order to find out more about how
        they operate, their strengths/weaknesses, features, and differentiators. Based from the analysis, it was apparent that almost all crowdfunding sites strive for similiar
        features - progress meter and donation goals. Because Ridestarter is a charity bike crowdfunding source,
        it's important that the application contains features unique to charity bike rides as well as some of the
          important crowdfunding elements. </p>

    <div class="personas"> <b>Personas </b>
      <p>After conducting four user interviews and compiling the survey, I created three
        user personas to reflect both the fundraiser and donor perspective. My goal was to develop
      empathy for the users and how they will interact with the application. </p>

      <div class="user_flow"> <b>User Flow</b>
        <p>Based on the user research, I finalized four user stories that I believe
          are important for users to navigate through their goals in Ridestarter:
          <b>Creating an Account, Browsing a Charity, Donating to a Charity, and Creating a Campaign.</b> </p>

      <div class="branding"> <b>Branding and Typography</b>
        <p> With Ridestarter being a crowdfunding application,<b> evoking trust</b> is one of the
          most important facets in getting users to use the site. Green is used as the primary color for
          Ridestarter because not only green associates with money flow, but also promotes
          a love for nature and foliages, which are all presented during a rider's journey. After careful consideration
          about the logo, I went with the less is more principle and used a typeface (Noto Sans) and a bike
          logo to evoke both professionalism and easy identification. </p>

      <div class="low_mockups"> <b>Low-Fidelity Wireframes</b>
        <p>In order to show potential users how the application is supposed to function and be built,
           I designed the low-fidelity wireframes in Balsamiq based from the user stories. It was also important
         to remember to design from both the donators and fundraisers' experience. Given that mind, I created
         wireframes from the fundraiser's perspective where they are able to manage and edit their projects. </p>

    <h1> GEARING THE DESIGN IMPLEMENTATION </h1> <hr>
    <div class="user_testing"> <b>User Testing</b>
      <p> I conducted a <b>contextual interview </b> on four different users to get feedback on the clickable
        prototypes in InVision. These are some of the most important guiding questions that I asked
        during the testing as they went through the website: </p>
      <p>1. Look at the homepage. What do you think this website is about? </p>
      <p>2. Find a challenge and make a donation. </p>
      <p>3. How do you feel about the checkout process? Do you feel it is intuitive and trustworthy? </p>
      <p> <b>Main critiques from the testing</b> </p>
      <p>1. User #1 pointed out that when he wanted to navigate back to
        My Account from the Creating a Fundraiser page, there were no option to do that unless you
         click on My Account on the navigation bar. <b> I added a back button both on the Creating a
         Fundraiser page and Guest Checkout page. </b> </p>
      <p>2. An interesting observation was that user #1 wanted to donate immediately
        right after discovering it, but the click directs him to the description page instead.
        <b>I took this input and added a donate button under each projects in both the homepage
        and the discover page. </b></p>
    </div>

  <div class="quotes">
    <p>“As someone who is passionate about cycling, I could see myself using

        <b>Designing an Intuitive Charity Page</b>
        <p>The “interested in riding” contact reinforces the goal of the application to bridge
        the gap between donating and inspiring potential riders to participate in the challenge.
        During user testing, one of the users pointed out that it would be useful to link the organization's official site where the funds
        are going to. This allows user to conveniently understand where exactly the donated funds are contributing.  </p>
        <p>Based on the user research, majority of participants think that the progress bar
        and fundraiser goal are the most important crowdfunding features. To accomodate this finding,
        I decided to emphasize the progress bar by making it relatively larger. </p>
        <p>During the in-person interview process, most users thought that the donor
        list would be useful to include because they usually don’t know how much to
        donate. For some interviewees, being featured as Top Donors add an
        incentive for them to make a donation. </p>

         process hinders their motivation to donate. In pursuance of getting users
         to quickly reach the end-stage of the donation process,<b> Ridestarter
         allows users to donate as a guest, </b> with no commitments to making an account. </p>

          challenge cards by oldest to newest, alphabetical order, and the completion rate.

    <b>High Fidelity Mockups </b> 
    <p>The solution from the preliminary user research and usability testing all
      resulted in a responsive and streamlined crowdfunding charity ride web application.
      I designed 24 high-fidelity wireframes in Sketch; below are some of the highlighted pages:</p>

  <div class="conclusion">
    <h1> Conclusion </h1>

    <p>If given more time, I would love the opportunity to spend more time doing usability
      testing early during the low-fidelity wireframing phase. Psychologically, I feel
      less wedded to low-fidelity prototypes and am more likely to make the changes on
      the user experiences. On the contrary, it’s omre difficult to give up or add a design
      element once I have already invest in a design. </p>

    <p>Testers were overall impressed with the design structure and content. Listening closely to users during
      the interview process helped me empathize with their motives and thought process. Additionally,
      analyzing user feedback and translating them into mockups is always enjoyable.
      Based on the feedback, trustworthiness is one of the most important aspect to getting
      users to use an application. Asking questions such as “Does this page follows the
       current trend in modernizing the style or buttons?” This could always be improved
       in any of my future design. </p>
