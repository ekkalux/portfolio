    <h1><span class="underline_black"> PROBLEM </span></h1>
    <p>There are a lot of existing crowd-sourced fundraising web applications such as Kickstarter,
      GoFundme, and Indiegogo. However, many of these applications cater towards personal or general projects. When pertaining to
      charity bike rides, a well-designed solution hasn't been created. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="solution_container">
    <h1> <span class="underline_black">SOLUTION</span></h1>
    <p>Ridestarter seeks to centralize charity bike rides across the world and allow users to crowd-sourced
      for ride projects. In addition to attracting the cyclist community, Ridestarter allows donors and fundraisers to come
      together in supporting charity rides for causes they care about. <a href="https://invis.io/72E98NCE6" target="_blank"> View the clickable prototypes here. </a> </p>

    <h5>Exploring the requirements </h5>
    <h1> RESEARCHING THE CHALLENGES  </h1>

    <div class="survey_findings">
      <p><strong>Survey Findings:</strong> At this initial stage, it was important to gain a better understanding of users' behavior of
        donating to a charity or spearheading a fundraiser. The survey was aimed towards a group of people
      who have made donations, created fundraiser projects, participated in charity bike ride and also users
      who have neither fundraised or donated.  <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1I71riCTMi-fcfzlis8xqgAgljlUzt9PmAgFs3RwU1fQ/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">
          Click here to view the survey responses </a> </p>
      <div class="highlights">
        <ul>
          <li>50% of respondents felt that the progress bar and fundraising are the most important
          features. </li>
          <li> 61% of respondents say that they rarely donate.</li>
          <li> 38.9% of respondents say that emotional videos will most likely make them want to donate. </li>
          <li>Some respondents felt the process of creating an account and going
          through the donation flow are a hassle that takes a toll of their time. </li>
          <li> When creating a campaign, 67% of respondents say that sharing their campaign through social media or email is the most
            important.
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p>In addition to the survey, it was also important to conduct user interviews on people who
        have been on charity bike rides and have experienced through the fundraising process.
        These are my findings: </p>

      <div class="highlights">
        <ul>
          <li> Fundraisers generally have to reach out to the organization that theyâ€™re
            supporting to host the fundraising site. This makes it hard to gain traction from
            the cyclist community to contribute fundings.  </li>
          <li> One interesting observation was that people are more likely to donate or feel more
            comfortable fundraising if the project entice challenges rather than just "asking for money". </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p> <strong> Data Insights: </strong>The data revealed the users' attitudes and motives towards donating. Based on the survey, there seems
        to be theme of users not knowing how much of an impact their donation will make or if they should trust the fundraiser. These results were important in deciding not only the features of Ridestarter, but also to design a transparent and
        trusting crowdfunding application. The goal here is to <strong>build trust through transparency</strong> so donors can appreciate the value of their donation and
      <strong>make an impact</strong> to the community. </p>

    </div>

    <div class="competitive_analysis">
      <p><strong> Competitive Analysis: </strong> I analyzed four different crowdfunding companies in order to find out more about how
        they operate, their strengths/weaknesses, features, and differentiators. Based from the analysis, it was apparent that almost all crowdfunding sites strive for similiar
        features - progress meter and donation goals. Because Ridestarter is a crowdfunding source for charity bike rides,
        it was important that the application contains features unique to cycling as well as some of the
          important crowdfunding elements such as a progress bar and fundraising goal.<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1f1FW3b75Uf-R_5KEUwpLFI_N9QV515_YGSm9SxUTedM/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">

    <div class="personas">
      <p><strong>Personas: </strong>After conducting user interviews and compiling the survey, I created three
        user personas to reflect both the fundraiser and donor perspective. My goal was to develop
      empathy for the users and how they will interact with the application. </p>

      <h5> The Framework </h5>
      <h1> RIDING THROUGH THE DESIGN CHOICES </h1>

      <div class="user_flow">
        <p><strong>Site Map:</strong> Before touching on the wireframes, I wanted to ensure the clarity of Ridestarter's goals and structures, I created a detailed sitemap to guide me through the
          later design process.
        <img src="images/ridestarter/sitemap.png">

        <p><strong>User Flow:</strong> Based on the user research, I finalized four user stories that I believe
          are important for users to navigate through their goals in Ridestarter:
          Creating an Account, Browsing a Charity, Donating to a Charity, and Creating a Campaign. This detaied information
        architecture serves as a template for the creation of the site. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0bktw2AN4LKaTg4d2pSb19PdWM/view?usp=sharing">

      </div>

      <div class="branding">
        <p> <strong>Branding and Typography:</strong> With Ridestarter being a crowdfunding application, eliciting trust and emotion are the
          most important facet in getting users to use the site. The color palette was comprised mainly of the color green. Green was used as the primary color for
          Ridestarter because not only green associates with money flow, but also promotes
          a love for nature and foliages, which are all presented during a rider's journey. </p>

        <p> The name Ridestarter was inspired by the crowdfunding site, Kickstarter.
          After careful consideration about the logo, I went with the less is more principle and used typeface Noto Sans and a bike
          logo to evoke both professionalism and easy identification. </p>

      </div>

      <div class="low_mockups">
        <p><strong>Low-Fidelity Wireframes:</strong> In order to show potential users how the application is supposed to function and be built,
           I designed the low-fidelity wireframes in Balsamiq based from the user stories. It was also important
         to remember to design from both the donators and fundraisers' experience. Given that mind, I created
         wireframes from the fundraiser's perspective where they are able to manage and edit their projects. </p>

  <div class="container">
    <h5> Usability testing </h5>
    <h1> building trust through transparency</h1>
    <div class="user_testing">
      <p> <strong>Moderated and Unmoderated Testing: </strong> I recruited 3 participants to conduct a moderated user testing and one tester for an unmoderated remote usability testing on usertesting.com.
         Testing revealed that users were able to intuitively navigate through the process of onboarding and making a donation.   </p>
      <div class="highlights">
        <ul>
          <li> What's your first impression of the homepage? What do you think this website is about? </li>
          <li> You are a veteran donor and would like to make a donation to a charity. Starting
          from the homepage, how would you find a charity bike project and make a donation? </li>
          <li> How do you feel about this crowdfunding application? What do you like or dislike, if any? </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p> <strong> Click Testing: </strong> Disclosing reputation and personal information were important
        for potential donors to empathize with the fundraisers and make a donation. However, I knew I was struggling with users intuitively navigating to the
        fundraiser's profile page. By gathering more than 50 click test responses, my assumption was wrong as majority of testers clicked on the correct element (creator's image).
        However, I wanted to further emphasize on the fundraiser's reputation. So I added another profile avenue for the outliers by creating a small button under the fundraiser's name to view their profile.</p>

    <div class="annotate_convey">
      <p><strong>Conveying Reputation:</strong> Based on the user research, one of the main factors in users not
      committing to a donation is being unsure of the fundraiser's trustworthiness. Donors must feel safe donating to creators so
    it's important to also focus on the project owner's credibility.  </p>

    <h1>CONCLUSION</h1>
    <p>Ridestarter has a value in allowing users to exclusively search and donate to charity bike rides,
      solving the problem of transparency in crowd-sourcing charity projects. Building an application with the goal to get people to not only get excited
      to donate money, but also build trust and transparency in the platform requires thoughtful decisions in the design process.
      Whatâ€™s difficult, but significant was coming up with the right questions to ask in the user survey in order
      to uncover underlying goals and motives. The interview process was a humbling experience in learning more
       about the different perspective from both the donators and fundraisers. Asking questions and
       empathizing to explore deeper into the usersâ€™ mind was an experience that allowed me to reflect
       on what is considered a good user interview process.  </p>

    <p>An area for improvement with Ridestarter would be to research more on what to include in a charity ride crowdfunding platform -
      what is needed to either get people interested in riding or donating to ride projects. The good news is that an application
      is never a final product as design and iteration is an ongoing process. I hope to further improve on the aesthetic and
      functionality of Ridestarter to create a good crowdfunding user experience. </p>
