    <h1> SUMMARY </h1>
    <p> Ridestarter is a crowdfunding website application for organizations and individuals looking to either raise funds or donate to charity bike rides across the world. Users can choose to create a bike campaign, supporting specific causes or browse through the different bike charities that are offered.</p>
  </div>
</section>

<section class="solution">
  <div class="solution_container">
    <h1> SOLUTION</h1>
    <p> The inspiration for creating Ridestarter originated from my experience in
      participating on two charity 500-mile bike rides. Through this experience, my
      group and I had to push an effort to raise funds for the supported organization
      - sponsoring our main directory to either gofundme or the organization’s donation site.
      What if our efforts were also channeled to a crowdfunding site, with the goal
      to bring together cyclist enthusiasts and interested donors.  </p>

    <p> The goal was to create a product that would aim to entice bike
      challenges for the community to partake in while raising awareness
      for causes that users care about. The application is also created for cycle
      enthusiasts who wanted to create a fundraiser and tell an adventurous story
      through their journey of making a difference in the community. </p>

    <h1> RESEARCHING THE CHALLENGES </h1>
    <div class="survey_findings"> Survey Findings <hr>
      <p>1. Most respondents were motivated to donate because they want to feel
      that they’re making an impact in the world. </p>
      <p>2. Some respondents felt the process of creating an account and going
      through the donation flow are a hassle that takes a toll of their time. </p>
      <p>3. People usually don’t donate because they are sketpical of donation sites -
      where the money is going to and how much of an impact they are making. Another
      popular response is that they feel that their donation is too small to make a difference. </p>
      <p><b>In addition to the general crowd of respondents and interviewees, I also turned the
      table to people who have been on charity bike rides. These are my findings:</b> </p>
      <p>1. Fundraisers generally have to reach out to the organization that they’re
        supporting to host the fundraising site. This makes it hard to gain traction from
        the cyclist community to donate. </p>
      <p>2. Most of the donors were generated from family member or friends. In addition,
        one interesting observation was that people are more estatic to donate if the individual
        or group partakes in a challenge rather than just “asking for money.” </p>

      <h1> RIDING THROUGH THE DESIGN CHOICES </h1>

      <div class="user_flow"> User Flow <hr>
        <p>Based on the user research, I finalized four user stories that I believe
          are important for users to navigate through their goals in Ridestarter:
          Creating an Account, Browsing a Charity, Donating to a Charity, and Creating a Campaign. </p>

      <div class="branding"> Branding/Typography <hr>
        <p>I designed the style guide in illustrator. I chose the font Noto Sans to use
           for the brand name. I wanted to keep the name simple, yet engaging so I added
            a bike icon above the title. Green is used as the primary color for Ridestater because
            it represents the imagery of what riders would see on their journey - nature, trees, lush
            foliages, and the wildlife. </p>

        <p>After finishing up the style guide, I proceeded to sketch the low-fidelity
          wireframes in Balsamiq. I designed the wireframes based on each user story that
          focuses on a particular problem. </p>

    <h1> GEARING THE DESIGN IMPLEMENTATION </h1>
    <div class="user_testing"> User Testing <hr>
      <p> I met up with four different users to conduct in-person usability testing on the
        high-fidelity mockups. These are some of the most important questions that I asked
        during the testing as they went through the website: </p>
      <p>1. Look at the homepage. What do you think this website is about? </p>
      <p>2. Find a challenge and make a donation. </p>
      <p>3. How do you feel about the checkout process? Do you feel it is intuitive and trustworthy? </p>
      <p> <b>Main critiques from the testing</b> </p>
      <p>1. User #1 pointed out that when he wanted to navigate back to
        My Account from the Creating a Fundraiser page, there were no option to do that unless you
         click on My Account on the navigation bar. <b> I added a back button both on the Creating a
         Fundraiser page and Guest Checkout page. </b> </p>
      <p>2. An interesting observation was that user #1 wanted to donate immediately
        right after discovering it, but the click directs him to the description page instead.
        <b>I took this input and added a donate button under each projects in both the homepage
        and the discover page. </b></p>
      <p> 3. It took a while for user #2 to understand the main objective of the
        homepage until she deciphered through the title, featured fundraisers, and
        “how does riderstater work.” <b>Based on this feedback, I inserted a motto “Ride
        as one, Raise as one,” on the hero image.</b> </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="quotes">
    <p>“As someone who is passionate about cycling, I could see myself using
      this website to bring riders and non-riders together”</p>
    <p>“The design is very clean and sleek...The color scheme and the homepage
       are captivating and trustworthy.”</p>
  </div>

  <div class="special_features"> Special Features <hr>
    <div class="charity_page_container">
      <div class="charity_page_text"> Designing an Intuitive Charity Page
        <p>Two of the most important functions in the info box are the “Interested
        in riding?” and the link to the donated organization - both highlighted in green. </p>
        <p>The “interested in riding” contact reinforces the goal of the application to bridge
        the gap between donating and inspiring potential riders to participate in the challenge. Additionally,
        during user testing, one of the users pointed out that it would be useful to link the organization's official site where the funds
        are going to. This allows user to conveniently understand where exactly the donated funds are contributing.  </p>
        <p>Based on the user research, majority of participants think that the progress bar
        and fundraiser goal are the most important crowdfunding features. To accomodate this finding,
        I decided to emphasize the progress bar by making it relatively larger. </p>
        <p>During the in-person interview process, most users thought that the donor
        list would be useful to include because they usually don’t know how much to
        donate. For some interviewees, being featured as Top Donors add an
        incentive for them to make a donation. </p>

        <p>According to my research, some respondents felt that the long checkout
         process hinders their motivation to donate. In pursuance of getting users
         to quickly reach the end-stage of the donation process, Ridestarter
         allows users to donate as a guest, with no commitments to making an account. </p>

        <p>Having a filter system is important to search for different types of

          total mileage of the challenge. Additionally, they can sort through the
          challenge cards by oldest to newest, alphabetical order, and the completion rate.
          This feature connects users to what they are specifically looking for when searching for a ride project. </p>

      I designed 24 high-fidelity wireframes in Sketch; below are some of the highlighted pages:</p>

  <div class="conclusion">
    <h1> Conclusion </h1>
    <p>Ridestarter was a project done for the online design program, Bloc. I drew
      inspiration from notable crowdfunding sites such as GoFundme and Kickstarter. The design
      contains ideas that I would love to see in a live crowdfunding website when
      considering to create or donate to charity bike rides. </p>

    <p>If given more time, I would love the opportunity to spend more time doing usability
      testing early during the low-fidelity wireframing phase. Psychologically, I feel
      less wedded to low-fidelity prototypes and am more likely to make the changes on
      the user experiences. On the contrary, it’s harder for me to give up or add a design
      element once I have already invest in time in a design. </p>

    <p>Testers were overall impressed with the design structure and content. Based
      on the feedback, trustworthiness is one of the most important aspect to getting
      users to use an application. Asking questions such as “Does this page follows the
       current trend in modernizing the style or buttons?” This could always be improved
       in any of my future design. </p>
