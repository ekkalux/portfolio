    <h1><span class="underline_black"> PROBLEM </span></h1>
    <p>There are a lot of existing crowd-sourced fundraising web applications such as Kickstarter,
      GoFundme, and Indiegogo. However, many of these applications cater towards personal or general projects. When pertaining to
      charity bike rides, a well-designed solution hasn't been created. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="solution_container">
    <h1> <span class="underline_black">SOLUTION</span></h1>
    <p>The goal of Ridestarter is to centralize charity bike rides across the world and allow users to crowd-source
      for ride projects. In addition to attracting the cyclist community, Ridestarter allows donors and fundraisers to come
      together in supporting charity rides for causes they care about. <a href="https://invis.io/72E98NCE6" target="_blank"> View the clickable prototypes here. </a> </p>

    <h1> RESEARCHING THE CHALLENGES  </h1><hr>

    <div class="survey_findings"> <b>Survey Findings</b>
      <p> At this initial stage, it was important to gain a better understanding of users' behavior of
        donating to a charity or spearheading a fundraiser. The survey was aimed towards a group of people
      who have made donations, created fundraiser projects, participated in charity bike ride and also users
      who have neither fundraised or donated.  <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1I71riCTMi-fcfzlis8xqgAgljlUzt9PmAgFs3RwU1fQ/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">
          Click here to view the survey responses </a> </p>
      <div class="highlights">
        <ul>
          <li>50% of respondents felt that the progress bar and fundraising are the most important
          features. </li>
          <li> 61% of respondents say that they rarely donate.</li>
          <li> 38.9% of respondents say that emotional videos will most likely make them want to donate. </li>
          <li>Some respondents felt the process of creating an account and going
          through the donation flow are a hassle that takes a toll of their time. </li>
          <li> When creating a campaign, 67% of respondents say that sharing their campaign through social media or email is the most
            important.
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p>In addition to the survey, it was also important to conduct user interviews on people who
        have been on charity bike rides and have experienced through the fundraising process.
        These are my findings: </p>

      <div class="highlights">
        <ul>
          <li> Fundraisers generally have to reach out to the organization that they’re
            supporting to host the fundraising site. This makes it hard to gain traction from
            the cyclist community to contribute fundings.  </li>
          <li> One interesting observation was that people are more likely to donate or feel more
            comfortable fundraising if the project entice challenges rather than just "asking for money". </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p> The data revealed the users' attitudes and motives towards donating. Based from the survey, there seems
        to be major theme of users skeptical of how exactly their money will make an impact.
        From analyzing the survey, it was safe to conclude that users typically make a one-time donation to friends or family.
        These results were important in deciding not only the features of Ridestarter, but also what
        was necessary in order to create a successful and trusting crowdfunding application.   </p>

    </div>

    <div class="competitive_analysis"> <b> Competitive Analysis </b>
      <p> I analyzed four different crowdfunding companies in order to find out more about how
        they operate, their strengths/weaknesses, features, and differentiators. Based from the analysis, it was apparent that almost all crowdfunding sites strive for similiar
        features - progress meter and donation goals. Because Ridestarter is a charity bike crowdfunding source,
        it was important that the application contains features unique to charity bike rides as well as some of the
          important crowdfunding elements such as a progress bar and fundraising goal.<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1f1FW3b75Uf-R_5KEUwpLFI_N9QV515_YGSm9SxUTedM/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">

    <div class="personas"> <b>Personas </b>
      <p>After conducting user interviews and compiling the survey, I created three
        user personas to reflect both the fundraiser and donor perspective. My goal was to develop
      empathy for the users and how they will interact with the application. </p>

      <h1> RIDING THROUGH THE DESIGN CHOICES </h1><hr>

      <div class="user_flow"> <b>User Flow</b>
        <p>Based on the user research, I finalized four user stories that I believe
          are important for users to navigate through their goals in Ridestarter:
          Creating an Account, Browsing a Charity, Donating to a Charity, and Creating a Campaign. This detaied information
        architecture serves as a template for the creation of the site. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0bktw2AN4LKaTg4d2pSb19PdWM/view?usp=sharing">

      </div>

      <div class="branding"> <b>Branding and Typography</b>
        <p> With Ridestarter being a crowdfunding application, eliciting trust and emotion are the
          most important facet in getting users to use the site. The color palette was comprised mainly of the color green. Green was used as the primary color for
          Ridestarter because not only green associates with money flow, but also promotes
          a love for nature and foliages, which are all presented during a rider's journey. </p>

        <p> The name Ridestarter was inspired by the crowdfunding site, Kickstarter.
          After careful consideration about the logo, I went with the less is more principle and used typeface Noto Sans and a bike
          logo to evoke both professionalism and easy identification. </p>

      <div class="low_mockups"> <b>Low-Fidelity Wireframes</b>
        <p>In order to show potential users how the application is supposed to function and be built,
           I designed the low-fidelity wireframes in Balsamiq based from the user stories. It was also important
         to remember to design from both the donators and fundraisers' experience. Given that mind, I created
         wireframes from the fundraiser's perspective where they are able to manage and edit their projects. </p>

    <h1> GEARING THE DESIGN IMPLEMENTATION </span> <hr>
    <div class="user_testing"> <b>Usability Testing</b>
      <p> User testing was important to gather either design feedback or any errors that user experienced.
        For this process, I conducted both a contextual interview on four different users and an unmoderately usability testing on usertesting.com
         to get feedback on the clickable prototypes that I created in InVision. These are some of the guiding questions that I asked
        during the testing as they navigate through the website: </p>
      <div class="highlights">
        <ul>
          <li> Look at the homepage. What do you think this website is about? </li>
          <li> Starting from the landing page, find a charity project and make a donation. </li>
          <li> How do you feel about the checkout process? Do you feel it is intuitive and trustworthy? </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="highlights">
      <h1> Insights gained from usability testing</h1>
      <ul>
        <li> For the first set of user testings, I reached out to some of my colleagues
          and and had them review my design in-person. Some of the feedback I recieved varied from things such as adjusting sizes
          in certain elements or changing the color of the call to action.

        <li> Some users pointed out that when they wanted to navigate back to
          My Account from the Creating a Fundraiser page, there were no option to do that unless you
          click on My Account on the navigation bar. To ensure a successful user experience, I added a back button both on the Creating a
          Fundraiser page and Guest Checkout page.  </li>

         <li> When user were donating, I noticed that there was a delay in deciding the donation amount. To speed up this process  , I added four
           amount options for users to choose from ($5, $7, $10, $15)
         </li>

          <li> In addition to testing in-person, I conducted an unmoderated remote usability testing on usertesting.com.
          The insight I gained from this method was valuable to eliminate any chance of biases. From the testing,
          the user quickly identified the landing page as crowdfunding page for charity bike rides. Judging from the hero image,
          the user thought that site is about a sporting company advertising their clothing brand. But later otherwise after reading some of the texts
          and scrolling down the page. After reviewing the landing page, users were then asked to make a donation starting from the homepage. As
          they navigate through a charity project, users liked the destination map as it gives them a visual idea of how far
          the ride would be. <a href="http://www.usertesting.com/v/0c0394a6-83ea-4a11-bedf-8691164ae105?encrypted_video_handle=ecowOnepaNaXBz98erLumg&shared=OLoy9ZlW" target='_blank'> View the video here!</a> </li>

    <h1><span class="underline_black"> CONCLUSION</span></h1>
    <p>Ridestarter has a value in allowing users to exclusively search and donate to charity bike rides,
      solving the problem of transparency in crowd-sourcing charity projects. Building an application with the goal to get people to not only get excited
      to donate money, but also build trust and transparency in the platform requires thoughtful decisions in the design process.
      What’s difficult, but significant was coming up with the right questions to ask in the user survey in order
      to uncover underlying goals and motives. The interview process was a humbling experience in learning more
       about the different perspective from both the donators and fundraisers. Asking questions and
       empathizing to explore deeper into the users’ mind was an experience that allowed me to reflect
       on what is considered a good user interview process.  </p>

    <p>An area for improvement with Ridestarter would be to research more on what to include in a charity ride crowdfunding platform -
      what is needed to either get people interested in riding or donating to ride projects. The good news is that an application
      is never a final product as design and iteration is an ongoing process. I hope to further improve on the aesthetic and
      functionality of Ridestarter to create a good crowdfunding user experience. </p>
