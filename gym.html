      <p> Finding the right gym is different for everyone. Whether that is location,
        price or types of services offered, users must go through a
      rigorous research process before making a commitment. When expectations aren't met, users are not satisfied with
      their gym and even worse, neglect their fitness goal.  </p>

    <div class="solution_container">
      <h1> <span class="underline_black">SOLUTION</span></h1>
      <p>Gymseeker makes the process of finding a gym easier by streamlining the research and selection phase based on users'
        needs. Users can search for gyms based on location, view gym's profile, and purchase/manage gym memberships.   <a href="https://invis.io/TUEP5Y8D9" target="_blank"><b> View the clickable prototypes here.</b> </a> </p>

      <div class="survey_findings">
        <b> Survey Findings </b>
        <p> I initiated my research by crafting a user survey in order to find out users' goals and pain points.
          Through this survey, I needed to learn the following: </p>

        <div class="highlights">
          <ul>
            <li> Users' fitness goals </li>
            <li> What factor is important in selecting a gym </li>
            <li> What frustrations they have with their current gym </li>
            <li> What stops users from going to the gym </li>
            <li> What type of membership do they currently have </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p> The survey was shared through social media, mutual friends, and people who regularly attend a local gym.
           The survey was completed with 41 respondents. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lfVgE3ZHnB_b_OIq3hhmVKv0sYLDmA1K7bA8-b5aMT4/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">

        <div class="highlights">
          <ul>
            <li> 48.8% of users ask for a day pass or free trial when commiting to a gym </li>
            <li> 51.2% of respondents are currently on a monthly membership plan </li>
            <li> 43.9% of respondents attested that the weight room is the most important amenity </li>
            <li> Location (85.4%), price (82.9%), and amenities/services (56.1%) are the three most important things when choosing a gym </li>
            <li> When asked what deters you from going ot the gym, most respondents answered exhaustion and overcrowding</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <img src="images/gymseeker/survey_findings.png">

        <p> With the discoveries I found through my survey, I was able to uncover the users' goals and pain points.
          It was clear that the main frustration with gyming has to do with convenience and time. With that said,
           I wanted to ease the users' pain in finding a gym by providing
           them with essential gym elements such as price, location, and amenities.

      <div class="personas"> <b>Personas </b>
        <p>To gain a better understanding of what specific features were desired, I complied my research from both the survey and in-person
        interview to come with three different personas: Avid gym-goer, occasional gym-goer, and amateur gym-goer. These personas will guide me to
        design an intuitive flow for Gymseeker. </p>

    <div class="user_flow"> <b>Information Architecture</b>
      <p> After getting a better insight of my users, I could move foward on user stories and user flows.
      Basing off from the research, I created user stories and made four user flows that are essential to crafting the important features and screens for
    Gymseeker. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/123lRp0UdWpR_rVzesVuoIFh29WfpIlTxFjVp7_xMhrc/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">

    <div class="branding"> <b>Branding and Typography</b>
      <p>Since the goal is to inspire users to achieve their fitness goals, Gymseeker
        needed a color palette and logo that would evoke a feeling of energy and
        motivation.

        I also took in consideration of icons for Gymseeker in order to help grab the attention and help users easily scan content.

    <div class="low"> <b> Low-Fidelity Wireframes </b>
      <p>With the completed user stories and user flows, I created low-fidelity mockups on Balsamiq and transfer it to clickable
        prototypes in Invision. I tested the prototyes in-person with a few friends and some people from my local gym. Some minor feedback includes making the filter button
        functional or changing the layout of certain elements. Taking in consideration of the feedback, I moved forward to creating high-fidelity wireframes. These
      are some of the initial sketches: </p>

    <h1>USABILITY TESTING </h1> <hr>
    <p> After multiple iterations from the low-fidelity mockups, I conducted a usability test with the high-fideliy clickable prototypes.
      I presented the application to four different testers.  <b>These are three separate tasks I had users complete:</b> </p>

    <div class="highlights">
      <ul>
        <li> You're not a fan of your current local gym and would like to buy a membership at another gym. Find
        a different gym and buy a membership. </li>
        <li> How easy or difficult was it to purchase a membership? </li>
        <li> Navigate to a gym's profile. Is the information here useful? Is anything missing from this page
        that are essential to choosing a gym? </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p> After usability testing, my goal was to analyze the feedback and uncover major pain points, if any.
      The conduction yielded positive interaction with some minor feedback and user errors: </p>

      <div class="highlights">
        <ul>
          <li> <b> Gymseeker's goal was easily identified: </b> Users didn't take long to understand the application's goal, providing many similarities to other apps such as Yelp. </li>
          <li> <b> Option to view weekly schedule: </b> One of the users wanted to look at the weekly schedule, but couldn't find an option to do so. I created a call to action in the gym's profile  </li>
          <li> <b> Map view over list view </b> I noticed that users tend to stay on the map view and didn't notice the list view option until otherwise mentioned. To fix this, I made both the map and list view options bigger and tested
          again with different users. </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <img src="images/gymseeker/map_user_test.png">

      <p>To test out my assumption that users have no trouble navigating to the list view and purchasing a membership,
      I created a navigation test on usabilityhub.com and was able to generate more than 25 responses. <a href="https://usabilityhub.com/tests/8383bdc11445/results/ac9b60656eab" target="_blank"> <b>Click here to view the test results.</b> </a> </p>

      <div class="highlights">
        <ul>
          <li> You're not a fan of your current local gym and would like to buy a membership at another gym. You also want to navigate to a list view. Navigate to a list view, find a gym profile, and buy a membership. </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <img src="images/gymseeker/heatmap.png">

      <p> The results indicated that users were able to successfully navigate to a different view and purchase a membership. This shows
      that the hiearchy is intuitively placed. What's interesting was that a few testers thought that the navigation icon is the list view,
    commenting that the visual is similar to a list. While this may be true, the data indicates that majority of testers understood the flow to purchasing a membership
      from an alternative view.</p>

    <h1><span class="underline_black"> CONCLUSION</span></h1>
    <p> Gymseeker is a project that I am particularly passionate about.
      As a fitness enthusiast who frequent the weight room, I have only considered
      locating gyms based on what types of equipments a gym has in their
      weight room. With Gymseeker, users are presented with a holistic detail of a gym's profile before
      making a commitment to purchasing a membership.  </p>

    <p> For this application, I delved deeper in the user testing process and made many iterations based on
      feedback. In future development of the current product, I would consider an additional feature that allows users to
    sort through the different types of gym - Yoga center, dance center, athlethic clubs, etc. This would provide users with a
  comprehensive direction to filter through their fitness goals. </p>
